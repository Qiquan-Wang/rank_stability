# Persistent Homology Rank Functions

\begin{Outline}

This repository contains data and code for reproducing the applications in the paper: ``Computational Stability for Persistence
Rank Function Machine Learning".

\begin{section}
For computing persistent homology rank function with single parameter filtration please refer to the folder 
The computation is carried out in Julia \cite{julia}, using Eirene \cite{eirene}. 
We apply this to the dataset
